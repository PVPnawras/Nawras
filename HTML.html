<p><b>So what is HTML? Html is in short, Hypertext Markup Language as it is the used computer language for programming a website with  the information that is needed on it, so lets continue? we could come and say that HTML is not hard, or YOU might think its hard, but the real answer is NO,Html is easy, if you focus enough, you will learn it like melting Ice, easy, but slow, Average hour take: 25 hours </b> </p>
<br>
<br>
<button><I>This is a button made using HTML!!!</i></button>
<br>
<p> Would you look at that? its a Button made with the command of <b><i> Use the Button command, Start with an opening tag "<" and then write "Button" then write what you want to write in it, after doing so, you will write the closing tag ">" then after you did that, do the same thing, but between the opening tag and the word "button", you need to write a slash, its that easy, isnt it??? well this website was made using HTML</i></b></p>
<br>
<P>did you see that? well, you should learn how to do all of those things, using our tutorial, so lets Start <br> First, lets start with something very simple, Start with the <!doctype HTml> command, it tells which type of language you are going to use, next up,  you should start with <html> and if you do not know which application to use, well i got ya, the reccomended software, is going to be VISUAL STUDIO CODE, heres a link https://code.visualstudio.com/download, Download it, it is probably reccomended, got it? well, we are also going to learn CSS later on (im going to use CSS during this)</P>
<br>

<input type="reset">
<br>
<input type="submit" value= Submit>
<br>
<br>
<P> would you look at that? these are the reset and submit button, it is put using Input then type = "submit" inside the input command </P>
<p><i>These were the Button commands, we have many others, along with the fact we just studied the begineer ones too</i></p>


<label for="file">Example for progress command</label>
<progress id="file" value="90" max="100"> 90% </progress>

<p>That is an example for the progress command as we can see that an example file is being dowloaded, this is the progress of how it could affect you and how it is a great aspect of design as we have alot of things that we need to do as the commands we are studying right now arent basic but we are taking the more interesting ones first as we will not learn all the 100 html tags as they are hard and complicated for some people so we wont learn them all, we will actually make alot of tags but we will mostly learn the imprortant ones as they arent hard</p>
<br>
<p>Let us list some basic commands with their benefits</p>
<ul>
  <li>1.Title</li>
  <li>2.Head</li>
  <li>3.br</li>
  <li>4.Paragraph</li>
</ul>
  <blockquote>Taken from W3 Schools</blockquote>

<p>let us start with the title tag, it is a relatively basic tag and it is also always used in websites, and webpages</p>
<q>In '93 to '94, every browser had its own flavor of HTML. .</q>
<br>
<time>9:00</time>
<br>
<p>we just used the time command and it tells the time and we can use it by putting <time> command into our HTML file, i reccomend using this command specifically</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <image src="D:\School\Private\Computer Science\U5\AY ISM\klematis4_big.jpg" height="20%" Alt="Klematis big"></image>
<br>
<br>
<p>Oh would you look at that, its a image!!!, but how did we get it? ever wondered how? well, theres a certain command and format for the image command as we have to start by < image > command and then open the command like this < image.. > and then you should write some specific things that you would need to know, first of all, you need to write the source, on your laptop, so you should open the picture, press the three dots, then click "Copy as Path" and then paste it inside your command, it should look like this: <br> <br> < image src="D:\School\Private\Computer Science\U5\hhM\klematis4_big.jpg"> <br> <br> this might look a bit nice, now, its time for the next step, inwhich, we need to specify the Height, and alt, the Height can be 20%, also dont forget to add " in between, and alt is like a specification on what picture to put if there was no picture there, oh well, just write the defintion or the name or specification for a picture, like for the image above, we would write klematis.</p>
